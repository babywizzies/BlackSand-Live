        question: "What type of Mounts are there?",
        answer: "At mint, BlackSand Mounts included 3 types of mounts.\n\n1. Mecha Ponies: Built from the remains of robots and ponies fallen during the QuantaPony War, they are powered by Quantum Crystals. Mecha Ponies are your key to participate in all BlackSand Racing events and they are the very fuel to ignite discovery across the Runiverse.\n\n2.One of One Mounts: Found roaming in the lands around BlackSand, new mythical species join the races! At first, the collection will include more than ten 1 of 1s mounts.\n\n3.Soul Ponies and Wild Soul Ponies: Not directly mintable, but only unlockable through the Burning Ritual, they are the very soul of both existing and long forgotten mounts. To claim one of them, you will be required to burn 2 or more Mecha Ponies.\n\nDifferent mount types/species have different racing abilities & have their own unique way of playing. @forgottenrunes Ponies will always be the core Racing Mounts. While it will not be easier to win with them, FRWC Ponies will always hold a special place amongst all Mounts.",
